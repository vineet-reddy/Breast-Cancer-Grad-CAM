## Project Overview

This project, developed for the 2024 Emory Health AI Bias Datathon, explores the use of Grad-CAM with ResNet to interpret how a model identifies breast cancer in mammogram images. By visualizing the model's focus areas, we provide insights into potential biases within the Emory EMBED dataset and the model's decision-making process.

## Key Components

### 1. Dataset Curation - Masked ROI (`Dataset_Curation.ipynb`)
Curates mammogram images into positive and negative groups based on BIRADS scores and diagnostic outcomes. The curated groups are then exported as CSV files for analysis.

### 2. Interactive Grad-CAM Visualization (`demo_grad-cam_visualization.ipynb`)
Visualizes critical regions in images using Grad-CAM on a pre-trained ResNet50 model, providing an interactive exploration of model inferences.

### 3. Emory Mammo Metadata Exploration (`Emory_Mammo_Metadata_Exploration.ipynb`)
Explores and visualizes metadata from the Emory EMBED mammogram dataset, offering insights into data relationships.

### 4. ResNet and Grad-CAM (`ResNet and Gradcam.ipynb`)
Combines ResNet50 and Grad-CAM to interpret model predictions on mammogram images, evaluating model performance through metrics like accuracy and AUC.
